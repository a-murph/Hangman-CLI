# Command-Line Hangman

This is a game of hangman that is played entirely in the terminal. It is made with Node.js using the "inquirer" NPM module.

## How to Play

After downloading, run `npm install` in the game directory to install inquirer and its dependencies. After installing, simply run `node index.js` from the game directory to start the game.

You will be presented with a word to solve, with all letters replaced by underscores. Simply guess one letter at a time to try to complete the word.

The word chosen is randomized each time, and no words are repeated until all possible words have been used.

All of the words are the titles of anime TV shows and movies that I am a fan of.
